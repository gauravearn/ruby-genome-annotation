# ruby_genome_annotation_iterator_large_scale
A genome annotation length calculator written in ruby. It invokes the shell subprocess with in ruby to parse the iterators at the faster rate. if you have dozens of genome sequenced, simply mention the column number and the iterator will hash the length. added support for the features as well to get a hash return. You can put the filename in the iterator. If you want to declare it then declare it with in a class as <<. remove the head from the shell iterator to do for all genes. I want to see the prediction length after genome annotation.
