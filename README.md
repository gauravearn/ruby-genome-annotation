# ruby_genome_annotation_iterator_large_scale
A genome annotation length calculator written in ruby. It invokes the shell subprocess with in ruby to parse the iterators at the faster rate. if you have dozens of genome sequenced, simply mention the column number and the iterator will hash the length. added support for the features as well to get a hash return.
